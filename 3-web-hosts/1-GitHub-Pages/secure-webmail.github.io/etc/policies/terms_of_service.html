      <h3>&ldquo;Secure Webmail&rdquo; Terms of Service</h3>
      <p className="small">Last modified: November 06, 2018</p>

      <h4>Welcome to &ldquo;Secure Webmail&rdquo;!</h4>
      <p>Thanks for using our products and services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;).</p>
      <p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-services"></div>Using our Services</h4>
      <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t misuse our Services. For example, don&rsquo;t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
      <p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don&rsquo;t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>
      <p>Our Services display some content that is not our own. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. Due to encryption, we are not able to review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies.</p>
      <p>Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-account"></div>Your Google Account</h4>
      <p>You will need a Google Account in order to use our Services. You may create your own Google Account, or your Google Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Google Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-protection"></div>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h4>
      <p>Our Services require that you grant permission to access messages in your Gmail account. Our Services will access only the minimum amount of data required to perform their proper operation. Our Services will not retain any data or meta-data belonging to your Gmail account. Our Services will not come into possession of the encryption key(s) necessary to decrypt any of the messages sent using our Services through your Gmail account. Due to encryption, we are not able to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-software"></div>About Software in our Services</h4>
      <p>The copyright holder of our Services gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by the copyright holder, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.</p>
      <p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-modification"></div>Modifying and Terminating our Services</h4>
      <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>
      <p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we&rsquo;ll be sorry to see you go. The copyright holder may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>
      <p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-warranties-disclaimers"></div>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h4>
      <p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don&rsquo;t promise about our Services.</p>
      <p>OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER NOR SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON&rsquo;T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-liability"></div>Liability for our Services</h4>
      <p>WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, AND SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>
      <p>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, AND SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).</p>
      <p>IN ALL CASES, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER, AND SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-business-uses"></div>Business uses of our Services</h4>
      <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify the copyright holder and affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>

      <h4><div id="toc-about"></div>About these Terms</h4>
      <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We&rsquo;ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We&rsquo;ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
      <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
      <p>These terms control the relationship between the copyright holder and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>
      <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don&rsquo;t take action right away, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
      <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
      <p>The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California&rsquo;s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and the copyright holder consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
