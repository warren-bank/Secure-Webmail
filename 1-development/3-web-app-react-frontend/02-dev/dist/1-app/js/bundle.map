<li>All of the stated goals are satisfied.\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>replacing the user interface (UI) to Gmail with a custom single-page app (SPA) gives complete control over what data is shared with the Gmail server\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>there is no automatic saving of draft messages</li>\r\n                <li>all cryptographic operations are performed in the client</li>\r\n                <li>only encrypted data is shared with Gmail for storage and distribution to recipients</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n
